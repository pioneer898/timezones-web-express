# TimeZone Web Express
This is a ready-to-go app for visualizing timezones. Compares hour-by-hour, and makes it easy to see what time it will be in different parts of the world. 

## Usage
This is a static app and is bundled for docker with `express`, so you can simply clone the repo, then run `docker-compose up -d` to run it locally.


## Demo
There is a live working demo of this project [here](https://time.pioneer898.com)
